## Audit - Coming Soon...

The audit seal is an important measure of transparency and reliability for us at PIG INU. It indicates that our project has undergone an independent audit, carried out by a specialized company in system security, finance and technology, which evaluated the finances and operations of the company, verifying compliance with established regulations and standards.

Having an audit seal brings several benefits to our investors:

* [x] Increased investor confidence: the audit seal provides an extra level of transparency and security, which can make investors feel more confident in investing in the project.
* [x] Access to a larger market: many investors are only willing to invest in projects that have undergone an independent audit and have a seal of approval.
* [x] Fraud prevention: the audit helps prevent fraud and protects investors against scams, as the company that performs the audit verifies that the project is legitimate and complies with applicable regulations.
* [x] Improved credibility: obtaining an audit seal can help improve the credibility of the project in the eyes of potential investors, business partners, and other stakeholders.
