# üêΩ Staking PIGINU

## Staking PIGINU

üê∑ Staking in PIGINU allows holders to "stake" their coins in a specific wallet to help keep the network secure and operational. In exchange for locking up their coins, coin holders receive rewards in the form of interest, which can be paid in PIGINU and other cryptocurrencies or tokens.

#### There are several benefits to participating in PIGINU staking, including:

* [x] Passive income generation: coin holders can receive passive income based on the amount of coins they are staking.
* [x] Network strengthening: staking helps keep the network secure and protected against malicious attacks, as coin holders participating in staking have a financial incentive to act honestly.
* [x] Increased price stability: staking can help reduce the volatility of the PIGINU price, as coin holders participating in staking may be less likely to sell their coins in the short term.
* [x] Incentives to hold coins instead of trading them: staking can provide coin holders with a financial incentive to hold their coins locked up instead of selling them in the short term, which can help reduce selling pressure on the PIGINU price.
